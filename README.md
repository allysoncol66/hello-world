# hello-world
First repository
I've been in the certificate program for Database Applications and Programming for a year and a half. Learned SQL, PLSQL, JavaSCript. SQL is the only non programming language I passed. Found this on the website while searching for example codes for an assignment I've been working on for several months and came accross this website.  Now I'm here, working on this.
